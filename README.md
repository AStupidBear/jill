# JILL - Julia Installer 4 Linux - Light

Simply install latest [Julia](https://julialang.org).

On Linux, the best way to install Julia is to use the Generic Linux
Binaries. And while **all Linux users** love manually downloading,
unpacking, and linking their software, this script does it for you.

Simply run

    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abelsiqueira/jill/master/jill.sh)"
